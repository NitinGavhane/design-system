## Accessibility Considerations

Accessibility is at the forefront of this project. When building your buttons, keep the following in mind:

- **Contrast**: Ensure sufficient color contrast for readability.
- **Focus States**: Clearly visible focus indicators help users who rely on keyboard navigation.
